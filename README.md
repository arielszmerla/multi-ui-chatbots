# LLM Comparator Extension

A Chrome extension that allows you to send prompts to multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, AskMe) simultaneously and get AI-powered summaries with **two analysis options**: local browser LLM or OpenAI API.

## üéØ Features

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Send the same prompt to ChatGPT, Claude, and AskMe simultaneously
- **Dual Analysis Options**:
  - **Local Browser LLM**: Intelligent analysis engine running entirely in your browser (free, private)
  - **OpenAI API**: Cloud-based analysis using GPT-3.5-turbo (higher quality, requires API key)
- **Intelligent Comparative Analysis**: Get structured insights with similarities, differences, and consolidated answers
- **Complete Privacy Option**: Local analysis never sends data externally
- **Smart UI Controls**: Settings adapt based on your chosen analysis method
- **One-Click Tab Management**: Automatically open AI service tabs

## üöÄ Setup

1. **Load Extension**: Load the extension in Chrome (Developer mode)
2. **Open AI Service Tabs**: Use the "Open Tab" buttons or manually navigate to:
   - ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com
